# DOOWA (App to facilitate donation in community by connecting people with donors)

## Introduction
After living in the COVID-19 pandemic for approximately 2 years now, we decided that we want to make something that can alleviate people suffering during this pandemic. We came up with a web application called ‘DOOWA’. The name DOOWA is derived from the Korean word ‘\textit{deobda}’ which means to help. The main function of our application is to connect individuals or families in the community who required assistance to survive during this pandemic to a donor in the community who are willing to lend a helping hand to reduce their hardship. We are hoping that this app will facilitate and encourage members of the community to help each other during this troubling times.
