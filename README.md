## Introduction
After living in the COVID-19 pandemic for approximately 2 years now, we decided that we want to make something that can alleviate people suffering during this pandemic. We came up with a web application called ‘DOOWA’. The name DOOWA is derived from the Korean word "deobda" which means to help. The main function of our application is to connect individuals or families in the community who required assistance to survive during this pandemic to a donor in the community who are willing to lend a helping hand to reduce their hardship. We are hoping that this app will facilitate and encourage members of the community to help each other during this troubling times.
