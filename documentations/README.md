# Doowa Term and Services

Welcome to Doowa!

These Terms of Use (or “Terms”) govern your use of Doowa, except where we expressly state that separate terms (and not these) apply, and provide information about the Doowa Service (the “Service”), outlined below. When you create an Doowa account or use Doowa, you agree to these terms. 

The Doowa Service is provided to you by Doowa, Inc. These Terms of Use therefore constitute an agreement between you and Doowa, Inc.

## The Doowa Service
We agree to provide you with the Doowa Service. The Service includes all of the Doowa products, features, applications, services, technologies, and software that we provide to advance Doowa's mission: To bring you closer to the people and things you love. The Service is made up of the following aspects:

   *  **Offering personalized opportunities to create, connect, communicate, discover, and share.**
   
         People are different. We want to strengthen your relationships through shared experiences you actually care about. So we build systems that try to understand who and            what you and others care about, and use that information to help you create, find, join, and share in experiences that matter to you. Part of that is highlighting                content, features, offers, and accounts you might be interested in, and offering ways for you to experience Doowa, based on things you and others do on and off Doowa.


   * **Fostering a positive, inclusive, and safe environment.**
   
        We develop and use tools and offer resources to our community members that help to make their experiences positive and inclusive, including when we think they might need         help. We also have teams and systems that work to combat abuse and violations of our Terms and policies, as well as harmful and deceptive behavior. We use all the               information we have-including your information-to try to keep our platform secure. We also may share information about misuse or harmful content with other Doowa                 Companies or law enforcement.


   * **Developing and using technologies that help us consistently serve our growing community.**
   
        Organizing and analyzing information for our growing community is central to our Service. A big part of our Service is creating and using cutting-edge technologies that         help us personalize, protect, and improve our Service on an incredibly large scale for a broad global community. Technologies like artificial intelligence and machine           learning give us the power to apply complex processes across our Service. Automated technologies also help us ensure the functionality and integrity of our Service.


   * **Providing consistent and seamless experiences across other Doowa Company Products.**
   
       Doowa is part of the Doowa Companies, which share technology, systems, insights, and information-including the information we have about you (learn more in the Data              Policy) in order to provide services that are better, safer, and more secure. We also provide ways to interact across the Doowa Company Products that you use, and                designed systems to achieve a seamless and consistent experience across the Doowa Company Products.
   
   
   * **Ensuring access to our Service.**
   
       To operate our global Service, we must store and transfer data across our systems around the world, including outside of your country of residence. The use of this global        infrastructure is necessary and essential to provide our Service. This infrastructure may be owned or operated by Doowa Inc., Doowa Ireland Limited, or their affiliates.
    
    
   * **Connecting you with brands, products, and services in ways you care about.**
   
       We use data from Doowa and other Doowa Company Products, as well as from third-party partners, to show you ads, offers, and other sponsored content that we believe will          be meaningful to you. And we try to make that content as relevant as all your other experiences on Doowa.


   * **Research and innovation.**
  
       We use the information we have to study our Service and collaborate with others on research to make our Service better and contribute to the well-being of our community.


## How Our Service Is Funded

Instead of paying to use Doowa, by using the Service covered by these Terms, you acknowledge that we can show you ads that businesses and organizations pay us to promote on and off the Doowa Company Products. We use your personal data, such as information about your activity and interests, to show you ads that are more relevant to you.

We show you relevant and useful ads without telling advertisers who you are. We don’t sell your personal data. We allow advertisers to tell us things like their business goal and the kind of audience they want to see their ads. We then show their ad to people who might be interested.

We also provide advertisers with reports about the performance of their ads to help them understand how people are interacting with their content on and off Doowa. For example, we provide general demographic and interest information to advertisers to help them better understand their audience. We don’t share information that directly identifies you (information such as your name or email address that by itself can be used to contact you or identifies who you are) unless you give us specific permission. Learn more about how Doowa ads work here.

You may see branded content on Doowa posted by account holders who promote products or services based on a commercial relationship with the business partner mentioned in their content. You can learn more about this here.


## The Data Policy

Providing our Service requires collecting and using your information. The Data Policy explains how we collect, use, and share information across the Doowa Products. It also explains the many ways you can control your information, including in the Doowa Privacy and Security Settings. You must agree to the Data Policy to use Doowa.


## Your Commitments

In return for our commitment to provide the Service, we require you to make the below commitments to us.

**Who Can Use Doowa.** We want our Service to be as open and inclusive as possible, but we also want it to be safe, secure, and in accordance with the law. So, we need you to commit to a few restrictions in order to be part of the Doowa community.

**How You Can't Use Doowa.** Providing a safe and open Service for a broad community requires that we all do our part.

        You don't have to disclose your identity on Doowa, but you must provide us with accurate and up to date information (including registration information), which may               include providing personal data. Also, you may not impersonate someone or something you aren't, and you can't create an account for someone else unless you have their           express permission.

   * **You can't do anything to interfere with or impair the intended operation of the Service.**
   
        This includes misusing any reporting, dispute, or appeals channel, such as by making fraudulent or groundless reports or appeals.
        
   *	**You can't attempt to create accounts or access or collect information in unauthorized ways.**
   
        This includes creating accounts or collecting information in an automated way without our express permission.
   
   * **You can’t sell, license, or purchase any account or data obtained from us or our Service.**
   
        This includes attempts to buy, sell, or transfer any aspect of your account (including your username); solicit, collect, or use login credentials or badges of other             users; or request or collect Doowa usernames, passwords, or misappr opriate access tokens.
        
   * **You can't post someone else’s private or confidential information without permission or do anything that violates someone else's rights, including intellectual property          rights (e.g., copyright infringement, trademark infringement, counterfeit, or pirated goods).**
   
        You may use someone else's works under exceptions or limitations to copyright and related rights under applicable law. You represent you own or have obtained all                 necessary rights to the content you post or share. Learn more, including how to report content that you think infringes your intellectual property rights, here.

   * **You can’t modify, translate, create derivative works of, or reverse engineer our products or their components.**
   
   * **You can't use a domain name or URL in your username without our prior written consent.**
   
        Permissions You Give to Us. As part of our agreement, you also give us permissions that we need to provide the Service.

   * **We do not claim ownership of your content, but you grant us a license to use it.**
   
        Nothing is changing about your rights in your content. We do not claim ownership of your content that you post on or through the Service and you are free to share your           content with anyone else, wherever you want. However, we need certain legal permissions from you (known as a “license”) to provide the Service. When you share, post, or         upload content that is covered by intellectual property rights (like photos or videos) on or in connection with our Service, you hereby grant to us a non-exclusive,             royalty-free, transferable, sub-licensable, worldwide license to host, use, distribute, modify, run, copy, publicly perform or display, translate, and create derivative         works of your content (consistent with your privacy and application settings). This license is for the purpose of making our Service available to you and to others that         access or use it. You can delete content individually or all at once by deleting your account. To learn more about how we use information, and how to control or delete           your content, review the Data Policy and visit the Doowa Help Center.
        
   * **Permission to use your username, profile picture, and information about your relationships and actions with accounts, ads, and sponsored content.**
   
        You give us permission to show your username, profile picture, and information about your actions (such as likes) or relationships (such as follows) for the purpose of           enabling us to show such information next to or in connection with accounts, ads, offers, and other sponsored content that you follow or engage with that are displayed           on Doowa Products, without any compensation to you. For example, we may show that you liked a sponsored post created by a brand that has paid us to display its ads on           Doowa. As with actions on other content and follows of other accounts, actions on sponsored content and follows of sponsored accounts can be seen only by people who have         permission to see that content or follow. We will also respect your ad settings. You can learn more here about your ad settings.

   * **You agree that we can download and install updates to the Service on your device.**


## Additional Rights We Retain

   * If you select a username or similar identifier for your account, we may change it if we believe it is appropriate or necessary (for example, if it infringes someone's            intellectual property or impersonates another user).

   * If you use content covered by intellectual property rights that we have and make available in our Service (for example, images, designs, videos, or sounds we provide that        you add to content you create or share), we retain all rights to our content (but not yours).

   * You can only use our intellectual property and trademarks or similar marks as expressly permitted by our Brand Guidelines or with our prior written permission.
   
   * You must obtain written permission from us or under an open source license to modify, create derivative works of, decompile, or otherwise attempt to extract source code          from us.

## Content Removal and Disabling or Terminating Your Account

   * We can remove any content or information you share on the Service if we believe that it violates these Terms of Use, our policies (including our Doowa Community                  Guidelines), or we are required to do so by law. We can refuse to provide or stop providing all or part of the Service to you (including terminating or disabling your your      access to the Doowa Products and Doowa Company Products) immediately to protect our community or services, or if you create risk or legal exposure for us, violate these          Terms of Use or our policies (including our Doowa Community Guidelines), if you repeatedly infringe other people's intellectual property rights, or where we are permitted        or required to do so by law. We can also terminate or change the Service, remove or block content or information shared on our Service, or stop providing all or part of the      Service if we determine that doing so is reasonably necessary to avoid or mitigate adverse legal or regulatory impacts on us. If you believe your account has been                terminated in error, or you want to disable or permanently delete your account, consult our Help Center. When you request to delete content or your account, the deletion        process will automatically begin no more than 30 days after your request. It may take up to 90 days to delete content after the deletion process begins. While the deletion      process for such content is being undertaken, the content is no longer visible to other users, but remains subject to these Terms of Use and our Data Policy. After the          content is deleted, it may take us up to another 90 days to remove it from backups and disaster recovery systems.

   * Content will not be deleted within 90 days of the account deletion or content deletion process beginning in the following situations:
	
        * where your content has been used by others in accordance with this license and they have not deleted it (in which case this license will continue to apply until that            content is deleted); or
        
        * where deletion within 90 days is not possible due to technical limitations of our systems, in which case, we will complete the deletion as soon as technically 		 feasible; or
      
        * where deletion would restrict our ability to:

		* investigate or identify illegal activity or violations of our terms and policies (for example, to identify or investigate misuse of our products or systems);
		
		* protect the safety and security of our products, systems, and users;
		
		* comply with a legal obligation, such as the preservation of evidence; or
		
		* comply with a request of a judicial or administrative authority, law enforcement or a government agency;
		
        * in which case, the content will be retained for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which it has been retained (the exact duration will vary on a 		  case-by-case basis).
		
   * If you delete or we disable your account, these Terms shall terminate as an agreement between you and us, but this section and the section below called "Our Agreement and        What Happens if We Disagree" will still apply even after your account is terminated, disabled, or deleted.


## Our Agreement and What Happens if We Disagree
## Our Agreement.

   * If any aspect of this agreement is unenforceable, the rest will remain in effect.
   * Any amendment or waiver to our agreement must be in writing and signed by us. If we fail to enforce any aspect of this agreement, it will not be a waiver.
   * We reserve all rights not expressly granted to you.


## Who Has Rights Under this Agreement.
   * This agreement does not give rights to any third parties.
   * You cannot transfer your rights or obligations under this agreement without our consent.
   * Our rights and obligations can be assigned to others. For example, this could occur if our ownership changes (as in a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets) or by law.

## Who Is Responsible if Something Happens.
   * Our Service is provided "as is," and we can't guarantee it will be safe and secure or will work perfectly all the time. TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, WE ALSO DISCLAIM ALL      WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.

   * We also don’t control what people and others do or say, and we aren’t responsible for their (or your) actions or conduct (whether online or offline) or content (including        unlawful or objectionable content). We also aren’t responsible for services and features offered by other people or companies, even if you access them through our Service.

   * Our responsibility for anything that happens on the Service (also called "liability") is limited as much as the law will allow. If there is an issue with our Service, we        can't know what all the possible impacts might be. You agree that we won't be responsible ("liable") for any lost profits, revenues, information, or data, or consequential,      special, indirect, exemplary, punitive, or incidental damages arising out of or related to these Terms, even if we know they are possible. This includes when we delete your      content, information, or account.

   * Notwithstanding the foregoing, applicable law may not allow the limitation or exclusion of liability set forth above. In such case, we shall bear liability to the extent        required by such law.
   

## How We Will Handle Disputes.

If you are a consumer, or where required by applicable law, the laws of the country in which you reside will apply to any claim, cause of action, or dispute you have against us that arises out of or relates to these Terms ("claim"), and you may resolve your claim in any competent court in that country that has jurisdiction over the claim. In all other cases, you agree that the claim must be resolved exclusively in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California or a state court located in San Mateo County, that you submit to the personal jurisdiction of either of these courts for the purpose of litigating any such claim, and that the laws of the State of California will govern these Terms and any claim, without regard to conflict of law provisions. Without prejudice to the foregoing, you agree that, in its sole discretion, Doowa Inc. may also bring any claim we have against you related to efforts to abuse, interfere or engage with our products in unauthorized ways in the country in which you reside that has jurisdiction over the claim.


## Unsolicited Material.

We always appreciate feedback or other suggestions, but may use them without any restrictions or obligation to compensate you for them, and are under no obligation to keep them confidential.


## Updating These Terms

We may change our Service and policies, and we may need to make changes to these Terms so that they accurately reflect our Service and policies. Unless otherwise required by law, we will notify you before we make changes to these Terms and give you an opportunity to review them at least 30 days before they go into effect. Then, if you continue to use the Service following the effective date of the changes, you will be bound by the updated Terms. If you do not want to agree to these or any updated Terms, you can delete your account, here.

# Submission Guidelines

## The Short

We want Doowa to continue to be an authentic and safe place where the community can help each other and prosper together. Help us foster this community. Post only your own photos and always follow the law. Respect everyone on Doowa, don’t spam people or post nudity.

## The Long
Doowa is a reflection of our diverse community of cultures, ages, and beliefs. We’ve spent a lot of time thinking about the different points of view that create a safe and open environment for everyone.

We created the Community Guidelines so you can help us foster and protect this amazing community. By using Doowa, you agree to these guidelines and our Terms of Use. We’re committed to these guidelines and we hope you are too. Overstepping these boundaries may result in deleted content, disabled accounts, or other restrictions.
In some cases, we allow content for public awareness which would otherwise go against our Community Guidelines – if it is newsworthy and in the public interest. We do this only after weighing the public interest value against the risk of harm and we look to international human rights standards to make these judgments.

•	Share only photos and videos that you’ve taken or have the right to share.

As always, you own the content you post on Doowa. Remember to post authentic content, and don’t post anything you’ve copied or collected from the Internet that you don’t have the right to post. Learn more about intellectual property rights.

•	Post photos and videos that are appropriate for a diverse audience.

We know that there are times when people might want to share nude images that are artistic or creative in nature, but for a variety of reasons, we don’t allow nudity on Doowa. This includes photos, videos, and some digitally-created content that show sexual intercourse, genitals, and close-ups of fully-nude buttocks. It also includes some photos of female nipples, but photos in the context of breastfeeding, birth giving and after-birth moments, health-related situations (for example, post-mastectomy, breast cancer awareness or gender confirmation surgery) or an act of protest are allowed. Nudity in photos of paintings and sculptures is OK, too.
People like to share photos or videos of their children. For safety reasons, there are times when we may remove images that show nude or partially-nude children. Even when this content is shared with good intentions, it could be used by others in unanticipated ways. You can learn more on our Tips for Parents page.

•	Foster meaningful and genuine interactions.

Help us stay spam-free by not artificially collecting likes, followers, or shares, posting repetitive comments or content, or repeatedly contacting people for commercial purposes without their consent. Don’t offer money or giveaways of money in exchange for likes, followers, comments or other engagement. Don’t post content that engages in, promotes, encourages, facilitates, or admits to the offering, solicitation or trade of fake and misleading user reviews or ratings.
You don’t have to use your real name on Doowa, but we do require Doowa users to provide us with accurate and up to date information. Don't impersonate others and don't create accounts for the purpose of violating our guidelines or misleading others.

•	Follow the law.

Doowa is not a place to support or praise terrorism, organized crime, or hate groups. Offering sexual services, buying or selling firearms, alcohol, and tobacco products between private individuals, and buying or selling non-medical or pharmaceutical drugs are also not allowed. We also remove content that attempts to trade, co-ordinate the trade of, donate, gift, or ask for non-medical drugs, as well as content that either admits to personal use (unless in the recovery context) or coordinates or promotes the use of non-medical drugs. Doowa also prohibits the sale of live animals between private individuals, though brick-and-mortar stores may offer these sales. No one may coordinate poaching or selling of endangered species or their parts. Remember to always follow the law when offering to sell or buy other regulated goods. Accounts promoting online gambling, online real money games of skill or online lotteries must get our prior written permission before using any of our products.
We have zero tolerance when it comes to sharing sexual content involving minors or threatening to post intimate images of others.

•	Respect other members of the Doowa community.

We want to foster a positive, diverse community. We remove content that contains credible threats or hate speech, content that targets private individuals to degrade or shame them, personal information meant to blackmail or harass someone, and repeated unwanted messages. We do generally allow stronger conversation around people who are featured in the news or have a large public audience due to their profession or chosen activities.
It's never OK to encourage violence or attack anyone based on their race, ethnicity, national origin, sex, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, religious affiliation, disabilities, or diseases. When hate speech is being shared to challenge it or to raise awareness, we may allow it. In those instances, we ask that you express your intent clearly. Serious threats of harm to public and personal safety aren't allowed. This includes specific threats of physical harm as well as threats of theft, vandalism, and other financial harm. We carefully review reports of threats and consider many things when determining whether a threat is credible.

•	Maintain our supportive environment by not glorifying self-injury.

The Doowa community cares for each other, and is often a place where people facing difficult issues such as eating disorders, cutting, or other kinds of self-injury come together to create awareness or find support. We try to do our part by providing education in the app and adding information in the Help Center so people can get the help they need.
Encouraging or urging people to embrace self-injury is counter to this environment of support, and we’ll remove it or disable accounts if it’s reported to us. We may also remove content identifying victims or survivors of self-injury if the content targets them for attack or humor.

•	Be thoughtful when posting newsworthy events.

We understand that many people use Doowa to share important and newsworthy events. Some of these issues can involve graphic images. Because so many different people and age groups use Doowa, we may remove videos of intense, graphic violence to make sure Doowa stays appropriate for everyone.
We understand that people often share this kind of content to condemn, raise awareness or educate. If you do share content for these reasons, we encourage you to caption your photo with a warning about graphic violence. Sharing graphic images for sadistic pleasure or to glorify violence is never allowed.
Help us keep the community strong:

•	Each of us is an important part of the Doowa community. If you see something that you think may violate our guidelines, please help us by using our built-in reporting option. We have a global team that reviews these reports and works as quickly as possible to remove content that doesn’t meet our guidelines. Even if you or someone you know doesn’t have an Doowa account, you can still file a report. When you complete the report, try to provide as much information as possible, such as links, usernames, and descriptions of the content, so we can find and review it quickly. We may remove entire posts if either the imagery or associated captions violate our guidelines.

•	You may find content you don’t like, but doesn’t violate the Community Guidelines. If that happens, you can unfollow or block the person who posted it. If there's something you don't like in a comment on one of your posts, you can delete that comment.

•	Many disputes and misunderstandings can be resolved directly between members of the community. If one of your photos or videos was posted by someone else, you could try commenting on the post and asking the person to take it down. If that doesn’t work, you can file a copyright report. If you believe someone is violating your trademark, you can file a trademark report. Don't target the person who posted it by posting screenshots and drawing attention to the situation because that may be classified as harassment.

•	We may work with law enforcement, including when we believe that there’s risk of physical harm or threat to public safety.

Thank you for helping us create one of the best communities in the world,

The Doowa Team
